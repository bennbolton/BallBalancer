# Stepper Motor
### Pros
- Precise position control
- Already on Robot
- High torque at low speeds
### Cons
- Introduce noise to the robot influencing IMU readings
- lack of smooth movements
- cannot torque control


# DC Motor
### Pros
- Smooth Torque Control
- Lots of existing solutions
- Minimal Noise to affect IMU
- Still High torque at low speeds

### Cons
- Expensive
- lots of extra setup work
- Requires more complex control system
- reduced torque at lower speeds
