# Things I did
- [ ] discuss stepper vs DC
- [ ] drive in a direction with speed
- [ ] fix issues with magnetometer
- [ ] magnetometer calibration
- [ ] 2d simulation from dynamic model
- [ ] studied LQR control and state space models


# Things to mention
- [x] the robot should be taller for better inertia
- [x] the ideal method would probably to take the acceleration approach as detailed in [[Fujipress_JRM-22-3-13.pdf|this paper]]
- [ ] maybe try and get an oscilloscope output of the AD9833 boards
- [ ] CAD issue with holes
- [ ] Filter vs average
- [ ] Need absolute orientation or just velocities/accelerations?
- [ ] get correct loop time results
- [ ] data of the robot balancing
- [ ] wheels falling off
- [ ] ESP32 needing less voltage / new circuitry
